# HI-FEVER

## **Hi**gh-throughput next**f**low **EVE** **r**ecovery
`hi-fever` is a Nextflow workflow for finding endogenous viral elements (EVEs) in host genomes. It aims to address common issues in paleovirology including cross-matches between host proteins and EVEs, computational burden of EVE searches and incompatability between software packages or platforms. We provide HI-FEVER as an accessible and informative workflow for any EVE-discovery project.

## Features

- Protein-to-DNA based search allows detection of divergent and ancient EVEs
- Designed to function with millions of input query proteins
- Reconstructs the predicted EVE protein based on its closest modern match
- Harnesses parallelisation to optimise compute resources
- Scales from laptop to cluster
- Conda and Docker compatible
- LINUX, Windows and MAC compatible

HI-FEVER provides a variety of output information about candidate EVEs, suited to many downstream purposes. Outputs include:
- Genomic coordinates of candidate EVEs
- Closest matches in the reciprocal databases, including full taxonomical information
- Predicted EVE protein sequences and cDNA (frameshift and premature STOP codon aware), with extension beyond original hit
- Extracted nucleotide sequence of each candidate EVE and flanking host genome sequence
- Metadata & statistics of the genome assemblies screened

## Installation and usage

HI-FEVER is available for use on LINUX, Windows (WSL) and Mac through Conda and Docker. Full documentation can be found in [the wiki](https://github.com/PaleovirologyLab/hi-fever/wiki).

## Test run
To experiment with and explore HI-FEVER options we provide instructions on running a test dataset below. All data used for this test are available on our Open Science Framework repository [here](https://osf.io/y357r/) in the sample_run folder.

**Preparation**

Ensure the required files are in the hi-fever/data folder:
* `query_20perfamNoRetro.fasta` protein query file
* `genome_human_ftp.txt` link to the human genome ftp
* `taxdump.tar.gz` taxonomy map file
* `MINI-nr_rep_seq-clustered_70id_80c_wtaxa.dmnd.tar.xz`: the minimal database built from the NCBI non-redundant database
* `MINI_rvdbv28_wtaxa.dmnd.tar.xz`: the minimal database built from the RVDB database

Unzip the reciprocal databases with the following tar commands:
```
tar -xf MINI-nr_rep_seq-clustered_70id_80c_wtaxa.dmnd.tar.xz
tar -xf MINI_rvdbv28_wtaxa.dmnd.tar.xz
```

If using conda, activate the environment. If using Docker on Mac (arm64), open a terminal tab within Docker desktop. If using Docker on LINUX add the -with_docker flag to the run command below.

Run the HI-FEVER workflow from the root hi-fever folder with the following command (replacing the email address):

`nextflow main.nf --query_file_aa 20_per_fam_no_retro.fasta --ftp_file human_T2T_ftp.txt --email john.smith@email.com`

This will generate a folder called `output` with two subfolders: `accessory_fastas` and `sql`. These outputs are detailed on our [Usage page](https://github.com/PaleovirologyLab/hi-fever/wiki/Usage). For a guide on how to interpret these results, see our [Interpreting results page](https://github.com/PaleovirologyLab/hi-fever/wiki/Interpreting-results)
